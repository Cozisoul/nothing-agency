# *nothing...* Agency Website v1.0

This repository contains the source code for the official website of the `*nothing...*` agency.

**Live Site:** `(The site is not yet deployed. The final URL will be https://nothing-agency.com)`

---

## Philosophy & Mission

The site is a single-page, award-ready web application built with a philosophy of **"Systematic-Poetic"** and **"Digital Brutalism."**

Our mission is to craft world-class digital experiences that are reduced to their absolute essence. We believe in the power of restraint, precision, and conceptual rigor. This project is inspired by the minimalist ethos of firms like `Manual` and the digital-first approach of agencies like `Basic`.

*   **v1.1:** Integration of a headless CMS for dynamic content management.
*   **v1.2:** Advanced animations and micro-interactions using a library like GSAP.
*   **v2.0:** A full rewrite using a modern framework like React or Svelte, depending on project needs.
